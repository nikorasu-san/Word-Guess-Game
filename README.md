# Word-Guess-Game
Objective: Create a hangman simulator.

## Overview
"Name that color" is hangman based game tasking the user to enter the correct name for the randomly generated color. This game theme was inspired by wanting to teach my nephew new colors. Hopefully this will spark a passion for him to learn new colors.

## Instructions
1. Press "Space Key" to start the game.
2. Observe the color tile presented. Press letter keys to fill in the blanks (or underscore) representing the color's name.
3. If the letter is included in the color's name, it will replace one or more of the blanks on the screen. If the letter is not included in the color's name, the counter for remaining strikes will decrease by one.
4. The round ends when all the letters for the color have been entered correctly or the remaining strikes has decreased to zero. The rounds won or rounds lost counters will increase accordingly.
5. After 4 rounds, the game will end. The user can press space bar again to start a new game.

## Shout-outs
* I used http://www.orangefreesounds.com for the sounds played during the game.
* I used https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/ to add a subtle texture to my background.
* The site is using Bootstraps v4.3 and "Bangers" Google Font.

## Future Recommendations for next version
* Consider functionality to change the background when a new game or new round has started to visually differentiate where you are in the game. A progress bar could also be an acceptable solution.

* Consider an collapse/expand area that will display the full instructions.

* I considered functionality to reveal words that were incorrectly guessed. I ultimately decided to not to include this function. There is a balance between replayability and education that is worth a little more thought. 

* Add more colors and allow color names with multiple words.

* Add functionality to allow the user to set how many rounds are in a game or set word difficulty.

* Develop a mobile friendly version of the game.
